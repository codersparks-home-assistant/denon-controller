#denon4j Java API

---

The denon4j project provides a Java API for communicating with a Denon AVR (currently only AVR1912 is full supported)
via TCP/IP. The project is intended to be easily extended for those who want to write an API for their own AVR model.

---

#Basic Usage
-----

```
Avr1912 avr = new Avr1912(host, port);
avr.connect(1000);
avr.volumeUp();
avr.disconnect();
```
