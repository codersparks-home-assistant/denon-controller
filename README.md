#denon4j Java API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stheves/denon4j.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sath1982/denon4j)

The denon4j project provides a java API for communicating with a Denon AVR (currently only AVR1912 is supported and tested)
via TCP/IP. The project is intended to be easily extended for those who want to write an API for their own AVR model.

Contributions are welcome!

# Prerequisites

- Java 8
- Maven 3.2+ (only for building)
- You must be connected to the same network as your AV receiver
- Your receiver must be either turned on or you have to enable the network standby feature

# Basic API Usage

```
Avr1912 avr = new Avr1912(192.168.0.102, 23);
avr.connect(1000);
avr.volumeUp();
avr.disconnect();
```

Take a look at the class Avr1912Demo.java in the test directory to view a complete example.

# Building

This is a maven style project so `mvn` needs to be on your `$PATH`. To build
from scratch just type:

> mvn clean package

This builds the executable JAR file that can be used on command line.

# Roadmap

- Full implementation of Denon AVR 1912 protocol
- Async network I/O
- More supported receivers
- There is much to improve...
