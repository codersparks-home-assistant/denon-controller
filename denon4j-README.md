# denon4j Java API

The denon4j project provides a higher level Java API for communicating with a Denon audio video receiver (currently only AVR1912 is tested)
via TCP/IP. It hides the complexity of the network receiver protocol and provides generic controls that can be used with every Denon receiver.
 
The project is intended to be easily extended for those who want to write an API for their own denon receiver model.

Contributions and feedback are very welcome!

# Features

- High level API and strong domain model
- Blocking and non-blocking request/response
- Auto-discovery of receivers found in LAN
- Lightweight and pure Java (no other dependencies needed)
- Works out-of-the-box with your denon receiver
- Available on Maven central

# Prerequisites

- Java 8
- Maven 3.2+ (only for building)
- You must be connected to the same network as your denon receiver
- Your receiver must be either turned on or you have to enable the network standby feature

# Basic API Usage

```
Avr1912 avr = new Avr1912(192.168.0.102, 23);
avr.connect(1000);
Slider masterVolume = avr.masterVolume();
masterVolume.slideUp();
avr.disconnect();
```

Take a look at the class Demo.java in the test directory to view a complete example.

# Command line usage

```
java -jar denon4j-[version]-cli.jar 192.168.0.12 23
Enter a command ('?' for help, 'q' for quit):
> ?

The following options are available:

?			Prints this help
q			Quits the program
<cmd>		Executes a generic command e.g. PW?
PW?			Returns the power state
PWON		Turns power on

See the Denon AVR receiver for a full list of commands.
> MU?
OFF
```
